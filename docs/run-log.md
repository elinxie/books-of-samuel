**2026-07-06 — Fable 5 — baseline session**
Repo init. Stack chosen (Vite/React/R3F/TS/Zustand/Zod/Vitest/Playwright).
Built: full data model (claims/passages/scenes/locations/characters/routes/
milestones/features/source-cards), 16 seeded source cards, Ziklag scene
(terrain/settlement/smoke/vegetation/reenactment via pure pose function), observer
camera (inspect+walk), quality profiles, full HUD (settings/teleport/inspector/
certainty panels), all study pages (landing/progress/features/sources/method),
unit tests (integrity/store/reenactment). Not yet done at handoff: e2e tests,
CI/deploy workflows, continuation docs (progress/next-run/run-log/model-handoff/
sonnet-continuation/fable-review-*/ADRs), `.claude/agents`, `.claude/commands`,
CLAUDE.md, real README. Handed off mid-build to Sonnet due to Fable usage limits.

**2026-07-06 — Sonnet 5 — continuation session 1**
Verified Fable's build: fixed 2 typecheck errors (unused import, vite manualChunks
overload), 1 lint error (dead `let` init), generated `sources/source-index.json` +
its build script. Ran full gate: 31 vitest + 6 playwright e2e all pass, build
clean, lint clean. Diagnosed sandboxed Playwright browser-path mismatch, fixed via
`PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_PATH` env override (no effect on real CI). Wrote full
continuation infrastructure: all `/docs/*` files (architecture, reconstruction-
method, uncertainty-register, asset-roadmap, bibliography, source-ingestion-policy,
automation, model-handoff, sonnet-continuation, fable-review-checklist,
fable-review-queue, progress, next-run, this log, 4 ADRs), `.claude/agents/*`
subagent roster, `.claude/commands/continue-samuel*.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, real
`README.md`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml` + `deploy.yml`. User's ask: make the repo
continuable across chats given limited Fable 5 usage — `docs/model-handoff.md`
now carries the concrete "spend Fable on / don't spend Fable on" policy (no tool
exists to read actual usage numbers, so this is a task-type heuristic, stated as
such). Next: see `docs/next-run.md`.
